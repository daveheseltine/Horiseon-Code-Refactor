# Horiseon Code Refactor (Trilogy Skills Bootcamp: Week 01 - Challenge)

## Important Note
Locally the project ran fine with linking resources such as:
> link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="./assets/css/style.css"

However GitHub Pages was not functioning with said links, and was edited to be linked as:
> link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="../horiseon-code-refactor/assets/css/style.css"

## Description
This week's challenge was an on-the-job ticket, which meant we began with a starter code to modify. The challenged was focussed on the very important aspect of web development of 'accessibility'.

Web accessibility is an increasingly important consideration for businesses. It ensures that people with disabilities can access a website using assistive technologies such as video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards. Making a website accessible is also good for business for many reasons, one of them being that accessible sites are better positioned in search engines like Google. It also helps companies avoid litigation that can occur when people with disabilities cannot access their website.<a href="#references">*[1]*</a>

## User Story 

```md
AS A marketing agency,
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards,
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines.
```
<a href="#references">*[1]*</a>

___
## Acceptance Criteria
The website must meet accessibility standards. It can be achieved by completing the following:

* Semantic HTML elements can be found throughout the source code.
* HTML elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning.
* Image and icon elements contain accessible `alt` attributes.
* Heading attributes fall in sequential order.
* Title elements contain a concise, descriptive title.<a href="#references">*[1]*</a>

## Mock-up
The following image and information was given to show the desired output from the challenge:

![The Horiseon webpage includes a navigation bar, a header image, and cards with text and images at the bottom of the page.](assets/img/01-html-css-git-challenge-demo.png)

> **Note**: This layout is designed for desktop viewing, so you may notice that some of the elements don't look like the mock-up at a resolution smaller than 768px. Eventually you'll learn how to make elements responsive so that your web application is optimized for any screen size.<a href="#references">*[1]*</a>
